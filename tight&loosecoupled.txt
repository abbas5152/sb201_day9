Q3/- Explain about loose coupling and tight coupling between application components with
an example

A3.
tight couple: If both class calls each other methods then we can say both are tightly coupled.
tightly couple sometime can generates some problem like if we want to change any class
we have to change everything in both the classes wherever we are using their methods.

for ex:
class Movies{
  void msg(){
   System.out.println("movies");
}
 
}
class Comedy{
Movies m=new Movies();
  void tc(){
   m.msg();
   System.out.println("comedy movies");
}
 
}
Here m object is dependency and Comedy class is dependent class.
and this is tightly coupled classes.If we change the method name in Movies class
we have to change it in dependency class too.

so to make it loosely coupled we have to two techniques:

1)apply POJO by POJI model.
2) Apply Dependency Injection

ex:

public Interface everyone{

     void go(){
   System.out.println("movies");
}
}

class Movies implements everyone{


  void msg(){
   System.out.println("movies");
}

@override
  void go(){
  msg();
}
 
}
class Comedy{
Movies m;

//constructor injection point
/*public Travel(Movies m) {
this.m=m;
} */


//setter injection point
public void setV(Movies m) {
this.m=m;
}

  void tc(){
   m.go();
   System.out.println("comedy movies");
}
 
}
so from now onwards we have to just changes the movies class method and not comedy class method
and this will become loosely coupled.
