Q2/- Explain about IOC and Dependency Injection

A2/-
IOC:

As we know to make two classes loosely coupled we need to apply dependency injection
mechanism and POJO by POJI mechanism.
earlier we are doing this thing manually but if any external enitity or framework do this work 
then we can say that control is inverted to that external framework and we called that 
framework as Inversion Of Control(IOC).

Dependency Injection:

So create two class loosely coupled we need to apply dependency mechanism.
there is two way to apply dependency injection
1)Using Constructor 
2) Using Setter Method
